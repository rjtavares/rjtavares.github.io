And that's the most important unit in a team sport like football. So imagine my surprise and great joy when I came across a fantastic dataset of full play-by-play data for all World Cup matches.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://rjtavares.github.io/posts/new-notebook-2.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2014 11:52:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>An exploratory analysis of the world cup final</title><link>http://rjtavares.github.io/posts/new-notebook.html</link><dc:creator>RJT</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This notebook shows how you can use play-by-play data to analyse a football match, showing custom measures and visualizations to better understand the sport.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://rjtavares.github.io/posts/new-notebook.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2014 11:52:19 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
