[How to get full world cup 2014 play-by-play data](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rjtavares/football-crunching/blob/master/notebooks/how%20to%20get%20full%20play-by-play%20data%20for%20the%20WC2014.ipynb)

Good football data is hard to come by. Basic stat counts are easily available, but full play data (i.e. a play broken down in its individual components: interceptions and tackles, runs, passes and shots, etc.) is very rare. And that's the most important unit in a team sport like football. So imagine my surprise and great joy when I came across a fantastic dataset of full play-by-play data for all World Cup matches.
